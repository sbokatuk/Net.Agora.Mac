# Builds and packs the Agora macOS binding packages listed in build/packages.tsv.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build/BuildNugets.sh                       # every package, each at its own version (below)
#   ./build/BuildNugets.sh --track signaling     # only the packages on one release track
#   ./build/BuildNugets.sh --suffix beta.12.34   # every package, with a prerelease suffix appended
#   ./build/BuildNugets.sh --track rtc --suffix beta.12.34   # both, in either order
#
# --track scopes the pack to one release track (see build/tracks.tsv): a signaling release builds
# only the Signaling package, not the whole repository. Releases pass it so a tag publishes only
# its own track; omit it and every package is packed, which is what CI and the pull-request beta
# want.
#
# Each package packs at its own <VersionPrefix> from Directory.Build.props: the packages sit on
# independent native version lines (RTC 4.6.x, RTM 2.2.x, Whiteboard 2.16.x), so no single version
# can be stamped across the set — which is why there is no way to pass one. Releases publish
# whatever versions the pins say, and nuget.org's --skip-duplicate makes republishing an unchanged
# version a no-op.
#
# Run build/fetch-video.sh (or the equivalent for whichever package you are packing) first — the
# xcframeworks are not fetched by this script.
#
# Packages are written to ../artifacts.
#
# Each .NET SDK's macOS workload ships reference packs for only two target frameworks - the .NET 9
# band covers net8/net9, the .NET 10 band covers net9/net10 - so this runs two passes and merges
# them. The repository's global.json pins the .NET 9 SDK, so the second pass is invoked from a
# scratch directory carrying its own global.json, since the SDK is resolved from the working
# directory.
